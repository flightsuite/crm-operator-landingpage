# FlightSuite SEO Phase 2: Days 31-60
## Growth, Outreach & Authority Building

**Start Date**: After completing Phase 1
**Focus**: Off-page SEO, backlink building, social proof, and content expansion

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 built the on-site foundation (schema, content, technical SEO). Phase 2 shifts focus to:
1. **Backlink acquisition** through targeted outreach
2. **Social proof** through reviews and testimonials
3. **Community presence** in relevant spaces
4. **Content authority** through guest posts and partnerships

**Key Difference from Phase 1**: Many tasks require human action (sending emails, posting on social media). Each of these tasks includes **ready-to-copy messages** so your team can execute without additional thinking.

---

## Task Categories

| Type | Icon | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Code** | `[CODE]` | I will execute this - content creation, technical work |

### Day 42: Product Hunt Preparation [HYBRID]

**Slack Message for Team:**

```
Hey team, today's task is to prepare for a Product Hunt launch.

**MY PART (already done):**
I've drafted the Product Hunt listing copy below.

**YOUR PART:**
1. Create a Product Hunt maker account if you don't have one
2. Start building your hunter network (follow 20-30 active hunters)
3. Schedule the launch date (Tuesday-Thursday works best)

**PRODUCT HUNT LISTING COPY:**

**Tagline (60 chars max):**
"Update your CRM with natural language - save 5-10 hrs/week"

**Description:**
FlightSuite is your CRM CoPilot. Instead of clicking through dashboards to log calls, meetings, and notes, just type or speak what happened in natural language.

"Just called John - he's interested in the enterprise plan, following up Tuesday"

FlightSuite automatically logs this to your CRM (GoHighLevel, HubSpot) with the right fields, tags, and timestamps.

**Key Features:**
- Natural language to CRM updates
- Works with GoHighLevel & HubSpot
- Chrome extension - no new tabs
- 30-second setup
- Free tier available

**First Comment to Post:**

"Hey Product Hunt! I'm [Name], one of the makers of FlightSuite.

We built this because sales reps spend 5-10 hours per week on CRM data entry. That's insane. Most of that time is just clicking around dashboards to log information they already know.

So we asked: what if you could just *tell* your CRM what happened?

That's FlightSuite. Type or speak naturally, and we handle the rest.

We'd love your feedback - especially if you use GoHighLevel or HubSpot. What features would make this a must-have for you?"
```

### Day 43: LinkedIn Company Page Optimization [HYBRID]

**Slack Message for Team:**

```
Hey team, today's task is to optimize our LinkedIn company page.

**YOUR PART:**
1. Log into LinkedIn as a page admin
2. Update the following sections with the copy below

**ABOUT SECTION (2,000 char max):**

FlightSuite is the CRM CoPilot that eliminates manual data entry for sales teams.

Instead of clicking through CRM dashboards to log calls, meetings, and notes, sales reps simply type or speak what happened in natural language. FlightSuite automatically updates GoHighLevel and HubSpot with the right contacts, fields, and timestamps.

THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE:
Sales reps spend 5-10 hours per week on CRM data entry. That's time they could spend selling. Worse, manual entry leads to incomplete data, missed follow-ups, and inaccurate pipelines.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. Install the Chrome extension (30 seconds)
2. Connect your CRM (GoHighLevel or HubSpot)
3. Type or speak naturally: "Just called Sarah - demo scheduled for Thursday 2pm"
4. FlightSuite logs it automatically

THE RESULT:
- Save 5-10 hours per week
- 100% complete CRM data
- Zero dashboard clicking
- Clean, accurate pipeline

### Day 44: First LinkedIn Post - Product Announcement [TEAM]

**Slack Message for Team:**

```
Hey team, today's task is to post our first official product post on LinkedIn.

**WHO POSTS:** Company page admin

**POST CONTENT:**

Sales reps spend 5-10 hours per week updating their CRM.

Clicking through dashboards. Finding the right contact. Filling in fields. Adding notes.

It's tedious. And it leads to incomplete data because people skip it when they're busy.

We built FlightSuite to fix this.

Now you just type what happened:
"Just called John - interested in enterprise plan, following up Tuesday"

And FlightSuite logs it to your CRM automatically.

No dashboards. No clicking. Just natural language.

Works with GoHighLevel and HubSpot. Chrome extension, free to start.

Try it: https://flightsuite.ai

Subject: Guest post idea: "The Hidden Cost of Manual CRM Entry (And How to Eliminate It)"

Hi there,

I'm reaching out because I've been reading [BLOG NAME] and love your content on sales productivity.

I'd like to pitch a guest post idea that I think would resonate with your audience:

**Title:** "The Hidden Cost of Manual CRM Entry (And How Top Sales Teams Are Eliminating It)"

**Angle:** Most sales teams know CRM entry is tedious, but few have quantified the actual cost. I'll break down:
- The math: 5-10 hours/week × $50/hour × 10 reps = $130K-$260K/year in lost productivity
- Why "just discipline" doesn't work (and what does)
- 3 automation approaches: AI assistants, voice-to-CRM, and integration tools
- Case study: How one team cut CRM time by 80%

I'm the founder of FlightSuite, a CRM automation tool, so I have hands-on experience with this problem. The post would be educational first - I'm not looking to write a product pitch.

Would this be a fit for [BLOG NAME]? Happy to adjust the angle based on what your readers respond to.

Best,
[Your Name]
FlightSuite
flightsuite.ai
```

**Goal**: 2-3 positive responses, 1 published guest post

**EMAIL TO SEND:**

Subject: Quick addition for your CRM resource page?

Hi there,

I came across your article on [best CRM software/tools] and found it really helpful.

I wanted to suggest a potential addition: FlightSuite (flightsuite.ai) - it's a Chrome extension that eliminates manual CRM data entry using natural language. Sales teams use it to update GoHighLevel and HubSpot without clicking through dashboards.

It's a bit different from the CRMs you've listed because it works *with* existing CRMs rather than replacing them. Could be useful for readers who are happy with their CRM but frustrated with the data entry process.

Here's our Chrome Web Store listing: [link]
And our website: https://flightsuite.ai

No pressure at all - just thought it might be a good fit. Thanks for the great resource!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Goal**: 1-2 links from resource pages

- How AI and natural language are changing the game
- Practical tips to cut CRM time by 80% (regardless of tools used)

## Week 4: Community & Social Presence (Days 52-58)

### Day 52: Reddit Strategy & First Posts [TEAM]

**Slack Message for Team:**

```
Hey team, today's task is to establish presence in relevant Reddit communities.

**IMPORTANT RULES:**
- Never directly promote FlightSuite
- Provide genuine value first
- Only mention FlightSuite when directly relevant and helpful
- Build karma before posting

**SUBREDDITS TO JOIN:**
- r/sales (1.2M members)
- r/salesforce (98K members)
- r/hubspot (15K members)
- r/smallbusiness (1.5M members)
- r/startups (900K members)
- r/Entrepreneur (3.5M members)

**ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:**

1. **Week 1**: Comment helpfully on existing posts (no promotion)
2. **Week 2**: Answer questions related to CRM/sales
3. **Week 3+**: Share valuable content when appropriate

**SAMPLE HELPFUL COMMENT (for a post about CRM frustrations):**

"I feel this. Spent years clicking through CRM dashboards after every call.

What helped me: batching updates at end of day instead of real-time. Less context switching.

Also started using voice memos to capture notes immediately after calls, then transcribing later. Faster than typing in the CRM directly.

If you have budget, there are some tools that let you update CRM via text/voice without opening dashboards. Game changer for field sales."

**SAMPLE POST (for r/sales, after building karma):**

Title: "How do you handle CRM updates when you're back-to-back on calls?"

Body: "Curious what workflows people use. I'm on 8-10 calls/day and by the time I have a break, I've forgotten half the details.

Currently doing voice memos right after each call, then batching CRM updates at end of day. Works okay but still takes 45 min.

What's working for you?"

[This invites discussion and positions you as someone who understands the problem]
```

### Day 53: Twitter/X Strategy & First Posts [TEAM]

**Slack Message for Team:**

```
Hey team, today's task is to establish FlightSuite on Twitter/X.

**ACCOUNT SETUP:**
- Handle: @FlightSuiteAI (or similar if taken)
- Bio: "CRM CoPilot | Update GoHighLevel & HubSpot with natural language | Save 5-10 hrs/week | Free Chrome extension"
- Link: flightsuite.ai
- Header: Product screenshot or value prop graphic

**POSTING SCHEDULE:**
- 3-5 tweets per week
- Best times: 8-10am, 12-1pm, 5-7pm (user's timezone)

**FIRST WEEK OF TWEETS:**

**Tweet 1 (Monday):**
Sales reps spend 5-10 hours per week on CRM data entry.

That's $10K-$26K per rep, per year in lost productivity.

The fix isn't "be more disciplined."

The fix is better tools.

**Tweet 2 (Wednesday):**
"Just called Sarah - she's interested in the enterprise plan, following up Thursday at 2pm"

That's a complete CRM update.

No dashboards.
No clicking.
No forgetting.

This is how CRM should work.

**Tweet 3 (Friday):**
The three types of sales reps:

1. Meticulous CRM updaters (rare, exhausted)
2. "I'll update it later" (never do)
3. "The CRM is fine" (it's not)

Which one are you?

**Tweet 4 (following Monday):**
Hot take: CRM data entry shouldn't exist.

Your CRM should understand:
"Called John, demo scheduled for Tuesday"

And log it automatically.

We built this. It's called FlightSuite.
flightsuite.ai

**Tweet 5:**
The #1 reason sales pipelines are inaccurate:

CRM data entry is manual.

Humans skip steps when busy.
Humans forget details.
Humans make typos.

The solution isn't more process.

It's less manual entry.

**ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY:**
- Follow 50-100 accounts in sales/CRM space
- Reply helpfully to 5-10 tweets daily
- Retweet relevant content with commentary
```

### Day 54: LinkedIn Content Calendar [HYBRID]

**Slack Message for Team:**

```
Hey team, today's task is to set up a LinkedIn content calendar.

**I'VE PREPARED:** 8 LinkedIn posts for the next 2 weeks (see below)

**YOUR PART:**
1. Schedule these in LinkedIn or your social media tool
2. Post Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10am or 5-7pm
3. Respond to all comments within 24 hours

**POST 1:**
The average sales rep spends 71% of their time on non-selling activities.

CRM data entry is one of the biggest culprits.

I've seen reps spend 45-60 minutes at the end of each day just updating their CRM.

That's 4-5 hours per week.
20 hours per month.
Over 200 hours per year.

On data entry.

The solution isn't "be more disciplined."

The solution is automation.

#SalesProductivity #CRM

---

**POST 2:**
"I'll update the CRM later."

The three most expensive words in sales.

"Later" turns into "tomorrow."
"Tomorrow" turns into "next week."
"Next week" turns into "I forgot what we talked about."

The result:
- Incomplete data
- Missed follow-ups
- Inaccurate forecasts

The fix: Update your CRM in real-time.

Not by being more disciplined.

By making it frictionless.

---

**POST 3:**
The irony of CRM:

Built to save time.
Ends up consuming it.

Built to improve relationships.
Ends up being about data entry.

Built to help you sell.
Ends up being a chore you avoid.

What if your CRM just... understood you?

"Called Sarah - she's buying next month."

And updated itself.

That's what we're building at FlightSuite.

---

**POST 4:**
Unpopular opinion:

Your CRM isn't broken.

Your data entry process is.

The CRM does exactly what it's supposed to:
- Store contact info
- Track deals
- Manage pipeline

The problem is getting data IN.

That's a UI/UX problem, not a CRM problem.

The solution: Better input methods.

Voice, natural language, automation.

The CRM itself is fine.

---

**POST 5:**
I tracked my CRM time for one week.

Day 1: 47 minutes
Day 2: 52 minutes
Day 3: 38 minutes
Day 4: 61 minutes
Day 5: 44 minutes

Total: 4 hours 2 minutes

On data entry. In one week.

That's when I knew something had to change.

What's your weekly CRM time?

---

**POST 6:**
The three levels of CRM automation:

Level 1: Integrations
- Sync email, calendar, etc.
- Passive data capture
- Still requires manual notes

Level 2: Templates
- Quick-add buttons
- Dropdown shortcuts
- Faster, but still clicking

Level 3: Natural Language
- "Called John, following up Tuesday"
- CRM updates automatically
- Zero clicking

Most teams are stuck at Level 1.

Where are you?

---

**POST 7:**
"We need more CRM training."

No, you don't.

You need less CRM friction.

If your reps need training to enter data, the UX is the problem.

The best tools don't require training.

They just work.

---

**POST 8:**
The real cost of manual CRM entry:

Direct cost:
- 5-10 hours per rep per week
- At $50/hour = $250-500/week
- Per rep. Not per team.

Indirect cost:
- Incomplete data
- Missed opportunities
- Inaccurate forecasts
- Rep frustration

Hidden cost:
- Good reps leave for companies with better tools

Total cost: Much higher than you think.

**VIDEO 1 SCRIPT:**

[TITLE]: How to Update Your CRM in 10 Seconds

[HOOK - 0-10 seconds]:
"What if I told you could update your CRM without opening a single dashboard?"

[DEMO - 10-50 seconds]:
"Here's how. I just finished a call with Sarah. Instead of clicking through GoHighLevel, I just type: 'Called Sarah - she's interested in the pro plan, following up Thursday.'

FlightSuite automatically logs this to my CRM. [Show CRM updating]

Contact updated. Activity logged. Notes added. Done."

[CTA - 50-60 seconds]:
"Link to try FlightSuite free is in the description. Takes 30 seconds to set up."
