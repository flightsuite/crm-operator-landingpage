## Research Insights

### Product Capabilities (from Loom Demo)

**Core Capabilities:**

2. **Natural language input** - Tell the extension what to record in plain English
3. **Bulk operations** - Handle multiple contacts and updates simultaneously
4. **Live CRM integration** - Real-time connection to GoHighLevel (HubSpot coming)
5. **Browser side panel interface** - Works alongside daily tools without tab switching
6. **Contact management** - Retrieve, add, and update contact information in bulk
7. **Note summarization** - Automatically summarize and attach notes to contacts

**"Aha Moments":**
- Execute bulk contact updates in one operation (vs. logging into CRM and clicking through)
- Talk to your CRM instead of typing into it
- Sales reps can focus on selling, not admin work

### Landing Page Conversion Best Practices (2025)

**From Chrome Extension Landing Page Research:**
- **Minimalist, uncluttered design** with generous white space
- **Free/pricing clarity** prominently displayed (FlightSuite is free to install)
- **Strong reviews/social proof** if available (we'll use placeholders + "trusted by" logic)
- **CTA prominence** - "Install for Chrome" visible above the fold
- **Demo/visual proof** - Show the extension in action (Loom embed)

**From B2B SaaS Landing Page Research:**
- **Hero section clarity** - Benefit-driven headline in first 5 seconds
- **Customer-first messaging** - Focus on outcomes ("save 5-10 hours") not features
- **Social proof placement** - Early in the page (section 2)
- **Multiple CTA placements** - Hero, mid-page, final block
- **Fast load times** - Critical for conversion (lazy load video)
- **Narrow positioning** - Single ICP focus (GHL users) outperforms multi-ICP
- **Trust blocks** - Address privacy, security, permissions objections
- **3-step "How it works"** - Simple process visualization

**Key 2025 Patterns:**
- Avoid "me-focused" copy - always lead with customer benefit
- Headline must communicate value prop in 5 seconds or less
- Slow pages kill conversion - optimize for performance
- AI/automation is table stakes - focus on specific outcomes
- CTA is a system, not just a button (placement + copy + friction reduction)
