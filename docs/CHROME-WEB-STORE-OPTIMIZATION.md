## Detailed Description (up to 16,000 characters)

```
FlightSuite is your CRM CoPilot — the fastest way to update GoHighLevel and HubSpot without clicking through dashboards.

🎯 THE PROBLEM WE SOLVE
Sales reps spend 5-10 hours per week on CRM data entry. That's clicking through dashboards, finding contacts, filling in fields, and adding notes. It's tedious, time-consuming, and leads to incomplete data when reps skip updates because they're busy.

💡 HOW FLIGHTSUITE WORKS
Instead of navigating your CRM, just type or speak what happened:

"Called Sarah - interested in the pro plan, demo scheduled for Thursday 2pm"

FlightSuite automatically:
✓ Finds or creates the contact
✓ Logs the activity with timestamp
✓ Updates relevant fields
✓ Adds your notes
✓ Sets follow-up reminders

No dashboards. No clicking. No forgetting.

⚡ KEY FEATURES

FlightSuite understands context and logs everything correctly.

Voice Commands
